# TFT-Touch-VFO-BFOfor-uBitxv3.1U
Aug 2018

A new version of software for low cost mcufriend TFT with Touchscreen based VFO + BFOs is out now along with an illustrated manual. This version (3.1cU) provides a row at the bottom to set / adjust both BFOs, PTT type selection (Toggle or Normal) , auto Time out duration setting , individual Offsets for each band, Touch Sensitivity, Lower and Upper limits for displays of S-meter and Power meter. Of course it continues to provide 3 VFOs (A/ B and Memory -100 channels), Direct Band selection, LSB/USB setting, Setting the frequency change step size from 1 Hz to 1 MHz, exchange of frequency between VFO and Memory, Saving all parameters on Demand , Split frequency operation, auto band Up /Down scanning and CAT control.

This system uses standard Arduino Mega board with compatible MCUFriend type TFT / Touch shield and either a standard Si5351 breakout board or one designed specifically for it which replaces Raduino board. This combination makes it very simple to assemble in a short time. Please note that this is only for experimenters who have some practical experience with Arduino and a bit of Hardware and keen to learn. There is no ready-made Kit as of now and all information is already available on our blog "vu2spf.blogspot.com" and on Github "github.com/sprakashb" . If there is someone willing to kit it for Ham friends I will be too happy to help.


This software version contains a few useful addons like a fifth row of display for setting the values of variables.
There is a manual for the system with pictures. The low resolution version is perfectly suitable and saves bandwidth.
PCB patterns for OPTIONAL pcb are available in various formats. Current Circuit diagram in pdf also in pcb folder.

Wishing you a great homebrewing experience,
